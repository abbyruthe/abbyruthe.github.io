This was an introduction to Python course that touched on the basics of different concepts of computer science and discussed topics like recursion, object-oriented programming, the basics of images, and more. All of these concepts are convered in our projects which can be seen below. The instructors for this course are Dr. Melissa Lynn, Professor Jeff Englehardt, and Dr. Michael Hvidsten.

## **Project 1**
*Let's Get Started!*  
This project was related to the basics of getting started with programming since this was an introduction to programming for many students. Tasks included practicing arithmetic operations, assignment to variables, and writing our first file and printing in the console.

The actual code for this can be seen in my GitHub repository in the link below.

## **Project 2**  
*Loops, Patterns, and Accumulations, Oh My!*  
Project 2 consisted of practicing for loops for both task 1 and 2.

The code and project description can be seen in the link below.

## **Project 3**  
*Child's Play*   
Project 3 focused on using if statements and practicing those among different types of children's games such as Rock-Paper-Scissors or translating English to Pig Latin and back again. 

More information about the description of the project or the code can be seen in the link below.

## **Project 4**  
*Crytanalysis*  
Project 4 consisted of learning about ciphers. This lab was an introduction to crytanalysis and it included making simple functions for completing the task of deciphering sentences. 

More information on the actual project can be seen below as well as the code.

## **Project 5**  
*Not-So-Elementary Statistics*  
Project 5 was learning how to write functions that could usually be found in the Math module in Python such as finding the maximum, minimum, average, standard deviation, count value, and the mode of an array of data. 

More information concerning the description of the project and the code for this can be seen below.

## **Project 6**  
*Your IMDb*  
This project focused on learning the basics of Python's flexible dictionary data structure by creating a movie database similar to IMDb. 

More information on the description of the project or the code can be seen below. 

## **Project 7**  
*Census Data*  
This project was related to reading and writing to files. One of the tasks of this project was related to determining out of 3 .csv files of data related to the population and the coordinates of that population, we had to determine which one was real and which of the other two were fake. This was done using Benford's Law. 

More information on this project can be seen below. 

## **Project 8**  
*#nofilter*  
This project focused on how to create and manipulate images.

More information on this can be seen below.

## **Project 9**  
*Tower of Hanoi*  
This project was about creating a simulated Tower of Hanoi using all of the resources we have so far learned about. 

More information on this project can be seen below. 

## **Project 10**  
*Tamagotchi*  
This project was about creating a Tamagotchi like pet that we programmed using object-oriented programming.
