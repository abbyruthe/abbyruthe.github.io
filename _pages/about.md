Interests
===== 

Importance of Data
====

I am an individual who wants to make the world a better place. Data is what helps distinguish between true and false in situations that otherwise may seem uncertain. This is why I have dedicated countless hours to reading and learning about manipulating, cleaning, and utilizing data in the classroom as well in real-world situations. 

My projects and experience display my passion for learning and growing as an individual whether individually or with others.

Renewable Energy
====
The environment is in dire need of people who care about it. The point that many individuals miss about global warming and the Earth changing so rapidly is that while the Earth may heal from toxic and somewhat irriversible catastrophes, we are hurting humanity more than ever. The human species will eventually die out and whether that is going to be within the next 150 years or the next 150,000 years or longer is solely dependent on what we do as a community of intelligent beings when we come together to discuss and come up with solutions to the climate crisis. 

This is a deep passion of mine that I would like to integrate into my work at a company or non-profit that cares deeply about the impact that this climate crisis has on us humans as well as the environment and every other species living in it.
