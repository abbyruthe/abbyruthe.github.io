I am a student pursuing my undergraduate degree with majors in Mathematics and Statitics and a minor in Computer Science at Gustavus Adolphus College. I have always had an interest in STEM, and it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I realized what area of STEM I wanted to focus on. My main interests lie in data analysis, programming, and applied mathematics. I appreciate the applied sciences because I feel that I can improve people's quality of life pertaining to the crises happening in the world today that could be analyzed with the use of a little bit of data.

## Topics of Interest

Some topics of interest that I would like to work on:
* Searching for a solution for the affordable housing crisis that is happening today in many urban areas in the nation.
* Working on the analysis and proposal for tax-free feminine products for all females and free products for girls and women who come from low-income households. 
* Improving technologies for renewable energy
