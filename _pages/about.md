Importance of Data
=====
I am an individual who wants to make the world a better place. Data is what distinguishs between true and false in situations that otherwise may seem uncertain. This is why I have dedicated countless hours to reading and learning about manipulating, cleaning, and utilizing data in the classroom as well in real-world situations. 

My projects and experience can display my passion for learning and growing as an individual.
